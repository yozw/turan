## Turan's Brickyard Problem code

(c) Copyright Yori Zwols and Serguei Norine

### Organization
The root directory contains five subdirectories:
* `3x3` and `3x4` contain the base files for the 3 x 3 and 3 x 4 problems
* `bin` is the target directory for compiled code
* `doc` contains documentation on the algorithms used and explains how to interpret the output of the code
* `src` contains the main code

### Prerequisites to run the optimization
* The code only works on Linux
* A Java compiler to compile the drawing enumeration code
* A C++ compiler (e.g. GCC) to compile the flag algebra code
* Matlab with Cplex to solve the semidefinite program
* Mathematica to verify the correctness of the solution

### Compiling and running
All information is in `doc/readme.pdf`.
